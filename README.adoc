This is the home of the RISC-V Toolchains SIG.
The SIG's charter can be found link:./charter.adoc[here].

* Chair: Christoph MÃ¼llner (VRULL)
* Vice-Chair: Ana Pazos (Qualcomm)

We are reporting to the Applications & Tools HC.

== Gap analysis

Gaps are listed in link:./gap-analysis.adoc[here].

== Regular meetings

The Toolchains SIG meets bi-weekly on Thursday 7 am (Pacific Time).
Meetings and join information can be found in the link:https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=tech.meetings@riscv.org[RVI calendar].

== Governed repositories and groups

Directly governed projects:

* link:https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-toolchain-conventions[RISC-V toolchain conventions]: Common command line interface for compilers: -march=..., vendor extensions, etc.
* link:https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-c-api-doc[RISC-V C-API]: Common C language extensions: preprocessor macros, intrinsics, function attributes, etc.
* link:https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual[ASM manual]: Common ASM language extensions: pseudo instructions, asm directives, relocations, etc.
* link:https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain[RISC-V GNU (+LLVM) Toolchain]: Build scripts to build RISC-V toolchain (Binutils, GCC/LLVM, newlib/glibc/musl, qemu)

Indirectly governed projects (via dedicated TGs):

* link:https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc[psABI]

== OSS projects with a tight relationship

Most members of the Toolchains SIG are also active in the communities
of the following OSS projects:

* Binutils
* GCC
* LLVM
* glibc
* Newlib
* GDB

Other related OSS projects are:

* QEMU
* Spike
* Linux
* FreeBSD
* OpenBSD
* OpenSSL

More RISC-V-specific information about the RISC-V SW ecosystem can be found
link:https://wiki.riscv.org/display/HOME/RISC-V+Software+Ecosystem[here].

== CI service for GNU toolchain

A CI service for several RISC-V GNU toolchain flavours can be found
link:https://ci.rvperf.org/view/GNU/[here].

This service is maintained by Wei Wu (PLCT).
Suggestions are discussed link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/issues/847[here].
