= RVI Toolchain & Runtimes HSC Meeting

Thursday, January 28, 2021

== Introduction

== psABI TG and Managed Runtime SIG: current status

* Christoph reports the status of the TG creation:
** Interviews in progress
** Working on formal steps of the inception phase as defined in Groups, Chair and Vice-Chair Approval Policy
*** description and preliminary charter (incl. deliverables) in an internal review
*** formal email of open positions in preparation
*** decision and forwarding to TSC for approval: end of next week
**Link to psABI repo: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md

== Proposal to move T&R meeting time to 07:00 Pacific Time

* Rationale
** Much of our current activity is currently being carried out by PLCT lab at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
*** It is very hard for them to have a fortnightly meeting that starts at 01:00.
*** The current start time is also outside the working day for groups in mainland and eastern Europe.
* Status
** Attempted to do a doodle, let's see the options:
*** Let's aim for 7 am (Pacific Time)
**** Mon: code speed, profiles and platform spec
**** Tue: Code size
**** Wed: Chairs
**** Thu: EABI, SIG HPC, RASD
**** Fri: Friday evening is not an option
** Proposal
*** Currently we use these time slots for SIG code speed and SIG code size
**** code speed: Mon 7 am
**** code size: Tue 7 am
**** use the opening slot for T&R
