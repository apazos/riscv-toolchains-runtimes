** Interviews were held
** Still open for applications until Feb 16 (application window of two weeks)
** Afterwards nominees will be forwarded to TSC
*** Nominees (incl. affiliation)
*** Bio
*** Preliminary charter
*** Required skills for applicants
*** Goals as expressed by the nominees
*** Deliverable
*** [If possible senior chair in combination with junior co-chair]

== T&R github repo

* Christoph introduces the T&R github repo
** Structural overview of location within RVI
** Current contents
*** Release dates of T&R related projects
*** RISC-V implementation status of GCC, LLVM
** Call for suggestions and ideas for additional contents
** Responses from all participants
*** Tracking status of:
**** GDB
**** OpenOCD
**** golang
**** Rust
**** V8/nodejs
**** OpenJDK
* Christoph mentions, that PR are welcome
* Mark suggests to split the list into a primary and a seconday list

== Release dates

* Christoph mentions the release dates page in the T&R github
  https://github.com/riscv/riscv-toolchains-runtimes/blob/master/releasedates.adoc
* GCC (rule of thumb: GCC closes the merge window for the next release in mid November)
* LLVM
* Binutils (rule of thumb: releases twice per year (mid July and mid January))
* Glibc (rule of thumb: Glibc releases twice per year (February and August))
* Newlib (rule of thumb: newlib releases once per year)

== GCC/LLVM sync-up calls

* There are two RISC-V calls, which are non-RVI events, but which are RISC-V centric:
** GCC RISC-V community meeting (Mar 11, 2021)
*** Schedule: biweekly, Thursday 7 am (PST), starting on Mar 11, 2021
*** Next meeting: Mar 11, 2021 at 7 am (PST)
*** Organized by Wei Wu (PLCT)
*** Public announcement: https://www.mail-archive.com/gcc@gcc.gnu.org/msg94197.html
** LLVM RISC-V
*** Schedule: biweekly, Thursday 8 am (PST), since Sept 2019
*** Next meeting: Feb 18, 2021 at 8 am (PST)
*** Organized by Alex Bradbury (lowRISC) and Ana Pazos (Qualcomm)
*** Public announcement: https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-February/148345.html

The T&R HSC chairs are planning to attend both calls on a regular basis.
The T&R HSC chairs are also the bridges to both communities.

* Mark: this events should be forwarded to Kim

== Extension support status

* We want to give an overview of the extension support status in GCC/LLVM
** Currently WIP
   https://github.com/riscv/riscv-toolchains-runtimes/blob/master/extension-support.adoc
** PRs are welcome, but also direct mail, etc.
** Goal: we want to provide an overview, so that we have a common understanding of the status

== Compiler explorer

* Christoph presents a quick overview of compiler explorer
* Interactive compiler
** Accepts C, C++ , Rust, Go, D, Haskell, Swift, Pascal, etc. (depending on the toolchain)
** RISC-V support since June 2018 (thanks Palmer Dabbelt)
** godbold.org (working frontend)
** https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer (sources)
** Support for GCC, LLVM
* Was stuck on GCC 8.2.0
** We fixed that last week: GCC 10.2.0 is now available as well
** riscv32 (rv32gc with ABI ilp32d) and riscv64 (rv64gc with ABI lp64d)
* Why using it?
** Nice tool to see generated code using different compilers
** See influence of compiler flags (-O3, -Ofast, -mtune=???)
** Compare hand-written assembly against compiler output

== V8

* Wei Wu and his team present the status of the V8 RISC-V port
* https://github.com/v8-riscv/v8/wiki
* 2021 V8 RISCV Roadmap-Items lists with priority from high to low
  https://github.com/v8-riscv/v8/issues/366#issuecomment-756183363
* Supported/tested systems
** HiFive Unleashed board
** QEMU
** x86 via simulated v8-riscv build

== Overlay TG: call for comments

* The overlay TG has prepared as standard
  https://github.com/riscv/riscv-overlay/blob/master/docs/riscv-overlay-software-standard-draft.adoc
* Ofer is providing a quick introduction
* Please review and provide your comments

== Open topics
