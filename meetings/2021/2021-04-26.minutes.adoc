== GCC atomics ==

* Christoph presents the objective of his work on GCC's A extension support
** The current implementation has a few limitations
*** Use of FENCEs vs ordering bits (.aq/.rl)
*** Use of I/O FENCEs in user space
*** store vs AMOSWAP
** Resulting tickets and patchset
*** PR100265: Use proper fences for atomic load/store
**** https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=100265
*** PR100266: Provide programmatic implementation of CAS
**** https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=100266
*** Patchset with fixes: https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2021-April/568684.html
** Side-effects
*** PR100264: REE does not work on PARALLEL expressions with a single register SET child
**** https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=100264
**** SC.W a3, a2, (a0) ; S.EXT a3, a3 //S.EXT is not needed, but REE cannot handle SC.W
**** REE...redundant extension elimination
**** Patch with fix: https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2021-April/568680.html
*** Binutils PRPR27764: Add tests for A extension
