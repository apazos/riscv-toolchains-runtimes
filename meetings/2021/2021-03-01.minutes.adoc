= RVI Toolchain & Runtimes HSC Meeting

Monday, March 1, 2021

== Introduction

* Christoph promotes the T&R github repository
* Christoph reminds of the GCC/LLVM sync-up calls
* Christoph provides the status of the psABI TG

== CFP for Development Tools and Tool Chains

* Christoph describes the publicly known details
* Open discussion for finding potential topics and presentors
* This will be continued offline (deadline for CFP is Saturday, Mar 6)

== RFC: Cryptographic Extensions TG's Proposed Krypto Intrinsics

* Request from the Crypto Ext TG for comments on intrinsics of their scalar krypto extension
* We've agreed to provide feedback within 7 days
* Philipp suggest to do this offline

== ELF flag conventions for extenions

* Mark has asked to put this on the agenda
* As this topics falls into the scope of the psABI TG,
  it will be documented and handled there.
* Currenlty there are no other documentation attempts for this topic.
* It is stated, that this topic will need supervision in case the new chairs
  will be blocked by the huge amount of backlog.

== Branch Management for GNU Toolchain

* There is a proposal from Kito for branch management of the GNU toolchain
* Affects mainly GCC, binutils and glibc
* On the corresponding T&R thread there is wide acceptance for his proposal #3
** Accept non-draft unratified extensions on master
*** Guarded with -menable-experimental-extensions
*** And must using explicitly version in -march string
    e.g. -march=rv64gcv is not accept, must be -march=rv64gcv0p9
** One extra branch for all draft unratified.
** Pros
*** Only master branch and one extra branch
*** Unratified extension available on master
** Cons
*** Still need some effort when draft becomes non-draft
* Palmer Dabbelt raised some concerns, we will discuss with him
* Next steps:
** Create policy document
** Reach out to binutils/gdb (glibc, LLVM) maintainers
*** Explain why it is needed and ask for acceptance
** Define branch location for draft unratified extensions
*** Proposal: GCC RISC-V vendor branch
*** PLCT lab offered to maintain this branches (contact: Wei Wu)

== CI service for RISC-V community

* Jenkins instance on https://ci.rvperf.org/
* E.g. Zfinx rv64gc toolchain
** https://ci.rvperf.org/job/plct-gnu-zfinx-rv64gc/
* Contact: Wei Wu
