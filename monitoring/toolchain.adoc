== Binutils

The GNU Binutils are a collection of binary tools
(GNU linker, GNU assembler, many other excellent tools
such as gprof).

releases twice per year (mid July and mid January).

=== RISC-V maintainers

* Andrew Burgess (Embecosm)
* Palmer Dabbelt (Google)

=== Releases

GDB major releases are approximately annually.
There are typically one or two minor releases each year.
This is the https://sourceware.org/gdb/schedule/[schedule]

- major release branch/pre-release approximately 1 month before release
- first minor release ("re-spin") approximately 3 months after major release.

At time of writing the most recent release was 10.1, released on 2020-10-24. Dates for branching (and hence release) of GDB 11 have yet to be announced.
